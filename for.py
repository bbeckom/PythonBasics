# for can be used to run against multiple items in a list

# create a list using [] and comma separating
mylist = ["val1", "val2", "val3"]

# create a temp variable to use in for loop that can be used to call each object.. in this example I used item but any
# string could be used
for item in mylist:
    print(item)
